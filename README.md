Concurrent Processing in Go

This small app is for Montana Programmers BigSky DevCon 2013.  It
demonstrates some basic features available in Go, such as:

* Parallel processing
* Interfaces
* Object inheritance
* Public vs private objects/properties
* Namespaces

In order to run the app, do

```
$ go get github.com/mgbelisle/flyfishing/flyfishing
$ cd $GOPATH
$ ./bin/flyfishing > ~/Desktop/cast_results.svg
```

and then open cast_results.svg in a browser to see the results.
